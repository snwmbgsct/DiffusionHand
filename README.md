# DiffusionHand - CS6244 Project

## Note:
Training and evaluation codes for 3D pose to Point Cloud task are provided. For RGB to 3D pose, I do not provide here for license issue.

## Introduction
I propose a pipeline to reconstruct a hand point cloud from a single RGB image, where we first estimate the 3D pose, then use it to reconstruct the point cloud.

## Contribution 
My contribution is utilizing the diffusion model for hand point cloud reconstruciton.
